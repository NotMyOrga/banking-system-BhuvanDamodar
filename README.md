## ðŸ§© The Task

Look for the `TODO` comments in files `Bank.java`, `BankAccount.java` and `OnlineShop.java`. 

The unit tests in `BankTest.java` will check that:

- Customers can be registered with an initial deposit.
- Deposits correctly increase the account balance.
- Withdrawals only work if there's enough money.
- Transfers between two registered accounts work correctly and only succeed if the sender has sufficient funds.

The unit tests in `OnlineShopTest.java` will check that:

- Items can be added to a user's cart.
- Orders can be placed if the customer has enough balance.
- Money is transferred from the buyer to the shop owner.

The shop is pre-filled with three items:
- Spezi â€“ 20â‚¬
- Cola â€“ 30â‚¬
- Sprite â€“ 25â‚¬
